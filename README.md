# Obfuscating-LLVM-Intermediate-Representation-Source-Code-with-NSGA-II---CISIS_2022

As a case of study, we chose three well known algorithms in computation:

AVL tree [1]: an algorithm that performs an order relation of the data by building
a balanced binary tree, so that the difference between the depths of the left-most
and right-most branches is not higher than 1.

Hamiltonian cycle: given some graph, this algorithm finds a path that starts and
ends in the same node, traversing the other nodes exactly once.

Huffman coding [2]: a data compression algorithm that represents symbols using
binary codes of different lengths, in such away that no code is the prefix of another.
The most frequent symbols are assigned to shorter codes.
